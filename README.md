password_revive
===============

Plugin for Round Cube Webmail Client.

Allowed each account the option to set a Security Question/Answer along
with an Email Address to mail a temporary password to in the event one
forgets their password.

A form will appear under the normal Round Cube Login form, asking for the
Security Answer and Question.  Easy to configure.  Option for Administator
of Roundcube to be notified by email when a password is reset.

Full localization.  Currently only en_US as I only know English.  This is
fully tested, but any additions would be welcome.
